# autoTicket
autoTicket is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the process of event registration on university event management platforms. Utilizing the Selenium WebDriver, the project provides a comprehensive solution for navigating through web pages, interacting with web elements, and completing registration forms with ease and efficiency.

The script is configured to operate on the Chrome browser and includes various functionalities such as setting Chrome path in system environment variables, initiating the browser in debugging mode, and manipulating web elements through XPath selectors. It provides capabilities to scroll through web pages, click on buttons, input text into forms, and ensure specific elements are loaded on the page.

In addition to web interaction, autoTicket features a function to parse and process JSON data, transforming raw data into a structured and more usable format. This functionality is essential for handling event data, whether retrieved from an API, a database, or any other data source.

The project is designed with readability and maintainability in mind. All comments and function names are provided in English, and arguments are translated to ensure a user-friendly experience. The modular structure of the code allows for easy updates and adaptations, ensuring that the tool remains relevant and functional as the target website evolves.

Originally tailored for a specific university's event platform, autoTicket can be easily repurposed and modified to automate similar tasks on other web platforms. This versatility makes it a valuable tool for anyone looking to automate web navigation, interaction, and data processing tasks, particularly in the context of event registration and participation.
